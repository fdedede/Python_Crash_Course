# Exercise Python 003: The sum of two values.
'''Create a program that reads two numbers and displays the sum between them.'''

num_1 = int(input('Insert the first value: '))
num_2 = int(input('Insert the second value: '))
sum = num_1 + num_2
print(f'The sum between {num_1} and {num_2} is {sum}')


''' This f along with the {} masks is very useful, good to let you train this syntax
to improve the code u.u'''
