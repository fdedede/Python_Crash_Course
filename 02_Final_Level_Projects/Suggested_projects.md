# Here is a list of suggested projects:

Whenever you are going to do a program that requires many lines, or that requires some more advanced logic, write a script of what you want to do, and if you are already a little more advanced in programming, create a general skeleton of the program, with the steps than you need to add.

### Create an odd or even game:

For this project you will only need the random library, and if you want to add a charm, use sleep, from the time library.
