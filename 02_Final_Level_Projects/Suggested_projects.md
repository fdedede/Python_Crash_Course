# Here is a list of suggested projects:

Quick tip: Whenever you are going to do a program that's bigger than usual, or that requires some more advanced logic, write a script of what you want to do, and if you are already a little more advanced in programming, create a general skeleton of the program, with the steps than you need to add. And always break it down, don't try to do everything, do piece by peace and see if it works, ok.

### Create an odd or even game:

For this project you will only need the random library, and if you want to add a charm, use sleep, from the time library. With that, you just need to know how to use looping and conditional structures to create the program logic and a little bit of math. It's a pretty cool challenge, good luck. [Here's an example](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python_Crash_Course/blob/main/02_Final_Level_Projects/odd_or_even_game.py)

### Rock, paper, scissors game:

You'll need random.choice(), if statements, and  user inputs. This is a great project to help you build on the fundamentals like conditionals and functions.

### Hangman game:

You'll need to work with dictionaries, lists, and nested if statements. You will also learn how to work with the string and random Python modules.

### Password Generator:

You'll collect data from the user on the number of passwords and their lengths and output a collection of passwords with random characters. For this project you will need to work with for loops and the random Python module.

### Tic-Tac-Toe and Tic-Tac-Toe AI:

For make a Tic Tac Toe game how to build a tic-tac-toe game you'll need to work with Python's time and math modules as well as nested if statements. For the AI version use the minimax algorithm which is a recursive algorithm used for decision making.

### Space Invaders Game:

### Connect Four:

### Tetris:

### Online Multiplayer Game:

### Web Scraping Program:

### Bulk File Re-namer:

### Weather Program:

### Discord Bot

### Binary Search:

### Minesweeper:

### Sudoku Solver:

### Photo Manipulation

### Markov Chain Text Composer:

### Pong:

### Snake
