# Welcome to Python! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ ヽ(o＾▽＾o)ノ (◕‿◕✿)	

If you found this "Crash Course", first of all thank you very much, I am very happy that you decided to use some of the materials I present here, knowledge only exists when it is shared and if this repository helps someone I'll feel fulfilled.

## Why should I learn this stuff?

Well, because it [pays](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/computer-programmer/salary) very well, a good programmer can earn about $100,000 a year or even more, and I want that (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ. Yeah... This is the first important lesson you should learn: slow down, take it easy, take a deep breath and learn how to walk before you start running. I'm saying this because, its easy to see all the news about how tecnology is the future, and how everyone should learn to code, you see the big wages and sometimes kids half your age making three times what you make, then the anxiety starts, and I'm not gonna lie, this shit is hard. Learn to code is easy, making good, useful and profitable code is not. But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying "give up, you won't make it". I'm on the same journey as you, my point is, don't just focus on the big paychecks because it's a very long journey to get there, and if your focus is all on the money... you're probably going to get frustrated. So stop thinking about the product, and let's focus on the process all right? Good. And remember: "For those who prove worthy, paradise awaits."
