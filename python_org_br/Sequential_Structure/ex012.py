# Extra Exercise 012
'''Make a Program for a paint shop.
The program should ask for the size in square meters of the area to be painted.
Assume that the paint coverage is 1 liter for every 6 square meters and that the paint is sold in 18 liter cans,
that cost R$ 80.00 or in gallons of 3.6 liters, which cost R$ 25.00.
Inform the user of the quantities of ink to be purchased and the respective prices in 3 situations:

a) buy only 18 liter cans;

b) buy only 3.6 liter gallons;

c) mix cans and gallons, so that paint waste is less.

Add 10% clearance and always round the values up, ie, consider full cans.'''
