# This repository contains a list of solved Python practice exercises.


I'm a data science student trying to learn to program in python, for that I'm taking some online courses and reading some books on the topic, all these materials offer exercises to fix the content.
This repository contains the list of proposed exercises plus other extra exercises and challenges that I found.
