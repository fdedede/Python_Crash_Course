# Welcome to Python Crash Course (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ ヽ(o＾▽＾o) (◕‿◕✿)		.

If you found this "Crash Course", first of all thank you very much, I am very happy that you decided to use some of the materials I present here, knowledge only exists when it is shared and if this repository helps someone I'll feel super fulfilled.

The idea of this repository is to offer some kind of python course in the most ELI5 way, in it you will find notes regarding the concepts covered called "Lessons", along with a list of solved exercises for practice (I recommend you to do them before seeing the solutions).

This is an introductory course and the concepts covered here are: Basic Syntax, Variables and Data Type, Conditionals, Type Casting and Exceptions, Functions and Built In Functions, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries and some more things. ヽ(^◇^*)/

Btw I'm using the Python 3 version.

## Course Syllabus:
Once again, welcome to this course, the purpose of this is to teach you the basics of the Python language in the most practical way, offering you dozens of exercises to practice, because practice makes permanent. In addition I will list dozens of extra materials for further research and studies. That's it, and good luck u.u

## Why should you learn this stuff?

Well, because it [pays](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/computer-programmer/salary) very well, a good programmer can earn about $100,000 a year or even more, and I want that. Yeah... This is the first important lesson you should learn: slow down, take it easy, take a deep breath and learn how to walk before you start running. I'm saying this because, its easy to see all the news about how tecnology is the future, and how everyone should learn to code, you see the big wages and sometimes kids half your age making three times what you make, then the anxiety starts, and I'm not gonna lie, this shit is hard. Learn to code is easy, making good, useful and profitable code is not. But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying "give up, you won't make it". I'm on the same journey as you, my point is, don't just focus on the big paychecks because it's a very long journey to get there, and if your focus is all on the money... you're probably going to get frustrated. So stop thinking about the product, and let's focus on the process all right? Good. And remember: "For those who prove worthy, paradise awaits."

### But why should you learn to code, for real?

Because it's fun, really, I don't know what your level is, but I'm going to assume you're quite a beginner, so trust me, when you solve your first problem that requires some sort of reasoning, or clever "trick", what we brazillians call "Gambiarra", you finish your script, then hit run and tcharam the program works, it's just works ＼(^ω^＼), it's really magical. But not just fun, is quite fulfilling and challenging as well. In addition to being the profession of the future. And, well, pays really good. 

Beyond that, why python? There are two types of people who want to learn to code, those who know what they want to do and, those who don't. If you already know what you want, good. Now, if you don't know, I'll give you three reasons why Python: 

1. [One of the easiest languages](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-python#:~:text=Python%20is%20widely%20considered%20one,lot%20of%20practice%20and%20patience.)
2. [One of the most popular](https://statisticstimes.com/tech/top-computer-languages.php)
3. [US$60k per year for good new devs](https://www.simplilearn.com/python-developer-salary-article#:~:text=The%20average%20entry%2Dlevel%20Python,year%20to%20111%2C605%20USD%2Fyear.)

I think that's enough, right? So let's get started (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

## Part 01 - [Fundamentals](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python_Crash_Course/tree/main/Main_list/01_Fundamentals)

In the first part, we'll talk about Python basics, variable types, getting user data, and then we'll make python your favorite calculator. After that I'll show you why python is one of the best languages (spoiler, packages). Then we'll talk about strings and close the part one with if statement.

Computers are good when they do repetitive tasks that we don't like, and we're going to learn how to do that now, in part two, first we're going to talk a little more about the if statement, using nested conditions (if, elif and else).
