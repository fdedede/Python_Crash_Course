# Welcome to Python (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ ヽ(o＾▽＾o)/ (◕‿◕✿)		.
# Work in progress
If you found this "Crash Course", first of all thank you very much, I am very happy that you decided to use some of the materials I present here, knowledge only exists when it is shared and if this repository helps someone I'll feel super fulfilled.

The idea of this repository is to offer some kind of python course in the most ELI5 way, in it you will find notes regarding the concepts covered called "Lessons", along with a list of solved exercises for practice (I recommend you to do them before seeing the solutions).

This is an introductory course and the concepts covered here are: Basic Syntax, Variables and Data Type, Conditionals, Type Casting and Exceptions, Functions and Built In Functions, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries and some more things. ヽ(^◇^*)/

Btw I'm using the Python 3 version.

## Course Syllabus:
Once again, welcome to this course, the purpose of this is to teach you the basics of the Python language in the most practical way, offering you dozens of exercises to practice, because practice makes permanent. In addition I'll list extra materials for further research and studies. That's it, and good luck u.u

## Part 01 - [Fundamentals](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python_Crash_Course/tree/main/01_Python_Crash_Course/01_Fundamentals)

In the first part, we'll talk about Python basics, variable types, getting user data, and then we'll make python your favorite calculator. After that I'll show you why python is one of the best languages (spoiler, packages). Then we'll talk about strings and close the part one with if statement.

## Part 02 - [Control Structures]()

So far we've been doing several challenges, some easier, some more difficult, but overall nothing too complex, and you might be asking yourself: "Okay, but when do I start doing something useful". Calm down young man, because we're going to start doing this now uhuuu. Computers are good when they do repetitive tasks that we don't like, and we're going to learn how to do that now, in part two, first we're going to talk a little more about the if statement, using nested conditions (if, elif and else). Then we'll talk about loops of repetition (for and while) and how not to crash your pc by falling into an infinite loop.
