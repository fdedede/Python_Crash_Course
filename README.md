# This repository contains a list of practical Python exercises and their solutions.


I'm a data science student trying to learn to program in python, I believe that before we start doing projects we need to master the basics of the language and how it works, basically not running it before starting to walk.

This repository contains a list of dozens of exercises exploring the basics of the Python language, such as Basic Syntax, Variables and Data Types, Conditionals, Type Casting, Exceptions, Built-in Functions and Functions, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries and some Packages

## Extra List 01:


- Ex001 - Make a program that asks for a monetary value and decrease it by 15%. Your program should print the message “New value is [value]
- Ex002 - Make a program that reads the validity of the information: a) Age: between 0 and 150; b) Salary: greater than 0; c) Gender: M, F or Other; The program should print an error message for each invalid information. 
- Ex003 - Let's make a program to verify who is the murderer of a crime. To find the killer, the police make a short quiz with 5 questions where the answer can only be yes or no: A) Do they live near the victim? B) Have they ever worked with the victim? C) Did they called the victim? D) Were they at the crime scene? E) Did they owe the victim? Each yes answer gives one point to the suspect. The police consider that suspects with 5 points are murderers, with 4 to 3 points are accomplices and 2 points are only suspect, needing further investigation. Values equal to or below 1 are released.

Inform the user of the quantities of ink to be purchased and the respective prices in 3 situations: a) buy only 18 liter cans; b) buy only 3.6 liter gallons; c) mix cans and gallons, so that paint waste is less. Add 10% clearance and always round the values up, ie, consider full cans.

### Notes:
- As I said before, I'm a Data Science student, and at the time I'm writing this note, I've been studying Python for less than 2 months. At this moment, the list isn't complete, I think I have about 60 exercises now, but my intention is to put here around 150~200, I'll update as I solve them.
- A second point is in relation to the solutions, all the exercises here, were solved by me, but as I said earlier I'm not a great programmer at the moment, actually not a programmer at all (not yet). Therefore, I know that my code is not as efficient and elegant as it could be, nor the most intuitive or well documented, anyway, if you want to contact me to ask something, call me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/marcoshsq), I will be very happy to help and who knows make a new friend.
- The exercise lists were obtained respectively from: The Main List is from [Curso de Python 3 - Curso em Vídeo (PT-BR)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHz_AreHm4dm6wYOIW20Nyg12TAjmMGT-); The Extra List 01 is from [Let's Code Pass Discord Community (PT-BR)](https://letscode.com.br/lets-code-pass?gclid=Cj0KCQiA64GRBhCZARIsAHOLriK5X5_lYL-rc3oOjFMPxCDsBxD-BNVkGHFIAbIrcNvfkKIn6aXJh_saAr1vEALw_wcB); The Extra List 02 is from [Python Brazil Official Community (PT-BR)](https://wiki.python.org.br/ListaDeExercicios).
