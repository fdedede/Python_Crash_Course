# Welcome to my Python Crash Course (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ	.


The idea of this repository is to offer some kind of python course, in it you will find notes regarding the concepts covered, along with a list of exercises for practice, along with their solutions.

This is an introductory course and the concepts covered here are: Basic Syntax, Variables and Data Type, Conditionals, Type Casting and Exceptions, Functions and Built In Functions, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries and some more things. ヽ(^◇^*)/

Btw I'm using the Python 3 version.
