- Exercise 001 - Write a program that asks for a value and shows on the screen if the value is positive or negative. 
- Exercise 002 - Write a program that checks whether a typed letter is a vowel or a consonant.
- Exercise 003 - Make a program that reads three numbers and displays the largest and smallest of them.

- Exercise 008 - The Tabajara Organizations decided to give their employees a salary increase and hired him to develop the program that will calculate the readjustments. Make a program that receives an employee's salary and adjusts it according to the following criteria, based on the current salary:

   - salaries between BRL 280.00 and BRL 700.00: 15% increase
   - salaries between BRL 700.00 and BRL 1500.00: 10% increase
   - salaries from R$ 1500.00 onwards: 5% increase After the increase is made, inform on the screen:
   - the salary before the readjustment;
   - the percentage of increase applied;
   - the value of the increase;
   - the new salary after the increase.

- Exercise 010 - Write a program that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation in the form ax2 + bx + c. The program should ask for the values of a, b and c and make the consistencies, informing the user in the following situations:

    - If the user informs the value of A equal to zero, the equation is not of the second degree and the program should not ask for the other values, being closed;
    - If the calculated delta is negative, the equation has no real roots. Inform the user and close the program;
    - If the calculated delta is equal to zero the equation has only one real root; inform it to the user;
    - If the delta is positive, the equation has two real roots; inform them to the user;

- Exercise 011 - Write a Program that asks for a date in the format dd/mm/yyyy and determine if it is a valid date.
