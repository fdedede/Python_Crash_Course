---

- Exercise 001 - Write a program that asks for a value and shows on the screen if the value is positive or negative. 
- Exercise 002 - Write a program that checks whether a typed letter is a vowel or a consonant.
- Exercise 003 - Make a program that reads three numbers and displays the largest and smallest of them.
- Exercise 004 - Make a program that asks the price of three products and tells you which product you should buy, knowing that the decision is always the cheapest.
- Exercise 005 - Make a Program that reads three numbers and displays them in descending order.
- Exercise 007 - Make a program that asks which shift you study. Ask to type M-Morning or V-Evening or N-Night. Print the message "Good morning!", "Good afternoon!" or good night!" or "Invalid Value!", as the case may be.
- Exercise 008 - The Tabajara Organizations decided to give their employees a salary increase and hired him to develop the program that will calculate the readjustments. Make a program that receives an employee's salary and adjusts it according to the following criteria, based on the current salary:

      - salaries up to BRL 280.00 (including): 20% increase
      - salaries between BRL 280.00 and BRL 700.00: 15% increase
      - salaries between BRL 700.00 and BRL 1500.00: 10% increase
      - salaries from R$ 1500.00 onwards: 5% increase After the increase is made, inform on the screen:
      - the salary before the readjustment;
      - the percentage of increase applied;
      - the value of the increase;
      - the new salary after the increase.

- Exercise 009 - Make a Program that reads a number and displays the corresponding day of the week. (1-Sunday, 2-Monday, etc.), if you enter another value, an invalid value should appear.
- Exercise 010 - Write a program that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation in the form ax2 + bx + c. The program should ask for the values of a, b and c and make the consistencies, informing the user in the following situations:

       - If the user informs the value of A equal to zero, the equation is not of the second degree and the program should not ask for the other values, being closed;
       - If the calculated delta is negative, the equation has no real roots. Inform the user and close the program;
       - If the calculated delta is equal to zero the equation has only one real root; inform it to the user;
       - If the delta is positive, the equation has two real roots; inform them to the user;

- Exercise 011 - Write a Program that asks for a date in the format dd/mm/yyyy and determine if it is a valid date.
- Exercise 012 - Write a program that reads 2 numbers and then asks the user which operation he wants to perform. The result of the operation must be accompanied by a sentence that says whether the number is:

       - even or odd;
       - positive or negative;
       - integer or decimal.

- Exercise 013 - Make a program that asks a person 5 questions about a crime. The questions are:

       - "Did you call the victim?"
       - "Were you at the crime scene?"
       - "Do you live near the victim?"
       - "Did it to the victim?"
       - "Have you ever worked with the victim?" 

The program must at the end issue a rating on the person's participation in crime. If the person answers positively to 2 questions, they should be classified as "Suspect", between 3 and 4 as "Accomplice" and 5 as "Murderer". Otherwise, he will be classified as "Innocent".

- Exercise 014 - Make a Program for reading three partial notes of a student. The program must calculate the average achieved per student and present:

      - The message "Approved", if the average is greater than or equal to 7, with the respective average reached;
      - The message "Fail", if the average is less than 7, with the respective average reached;
      - The message "Passed with Distinction", if the average is equal to 10.

- Exercise 015 - A gas station is selling fuel with the following discount table:

      Alcohol:
      up to 20 liters, 3% discount per liter
      over 20 liters, 5% discount per liter

      Gasoline:
      up to 20 liters, 4% discount per liter
      over 20 liters, 6% discount per liter 

Write an algorithm that reads the number of liters sold, the type of fuel (coded as follows: A-alcohol, G-gasoline), calculates and prints the amount to be paid by the customer knowing that the price of a liter of gasoline is R$ 2.50 the price of a liter of alcohol is R$ 1.90.

- Exercise 016 - A fruit vendor is selling fruit at the following price list:

| --- | Up to 5 Kg | Over 5 Kg |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Strawberry | R$ 2.50 per Kg | R$ 2.20 per Kg |
| Apple | R$ 1.80 per Kg | R$ 1.50 per Kg |

If the customer buys more than 8 kg of fruit or the total value of the purchase exceeds R$ 25.00, he will also receive a 10% discount on this total. Write an algorithm to read the quantity (in Kg) of strawberries and the quantity (in Kg) of apples purchased and write the amount to be paid by the customer.

If the purchase is made using the Tabajara card, the customer will also receive a 5% discount on the total purchase.
