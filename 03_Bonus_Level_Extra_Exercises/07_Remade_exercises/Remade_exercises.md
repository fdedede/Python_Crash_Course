# Remade exercises

The list of exercises available in this repository are arranged in a progressive order of knowledge, so some concepts that could be applied in the first exercises such as lists or functions, were not used, because they had not yet been introduced. However, I find the idea of redoing the exercises applying more advanced concepts very interesting. this folder, remade exercises will have some exercises selected from the list solved by applying such concepts.
