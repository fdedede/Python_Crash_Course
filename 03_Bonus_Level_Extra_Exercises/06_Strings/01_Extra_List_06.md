### A list of extra exercises for those who are eager to learn. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

The exercises vary in difficulty, some being trivial, others quite challenging.

---

- Exercise 001 - String size. Write a program that reads 2 strings and reports their content followed by their length. Also inform if the two strings have the same length and are the same or different in content.

      Compare two strings
      String 1: Brasil Hexa 2006
      String 2: Brazil! Hexa 2006!
      Size of "Brasil Hexa 2006": 16 characters
      Size of "Brasil! Hexa 2006!": 18 characters
      The two strings are of different lengths.
      The two strings have different content.

- Exercise 002 - Name backwards in uppercase. Write a program that allows the user to type their name and then displays the user's name backwards using only capital letters. Tip: remember that when entering the name, the user can type uppercase or lowercase letters.

- Exercise 003 - Name vertically. Make a program that asks for the username and prints it vertically.

      F
      U
      L
      A
      N
      O

- Exercise 004 - Name vertically in ladder. Modify the previous program to show the name in ladder format.

      F
      FU
      FUL
      FULA
      FULAN
      FULANO

- Exercise 005 - Name vertically in inverted ladder. Change the previous program so that the ladder is inverted.

      FULANO
      FULAN
      FULA
      FUL
      FU
      F

- Exercise 006 - Date in full. Write a program that requests the user's date of birth (dd/mm/yyyy) and prints the date with the month name in full.

      Date of Birth: 10/29/1973
      You were born on October 29, 1973.

- Exercise 007 - Count spaces and vowels. Given a string with a user-supplied phrase (including whitespace), count:

      how many blank spaces are there in the sentence.
      how many times do the vowels a, e, i, o, u appear.

- Exercise 008 - A palindrome is a string of characters whose reading is identical whether done from right to left or vice versa. For example: BONE and EGG are palindromes. In more complex texts, spaces and punctuation are ignored. The sentence SUBI NO ONIBUS is an example of a palindromic sentence where spaces were ignored. Write a program that reads a string of characters, displays it and tells whether it is a palindrome or not.

- Exercise 009 - Develop a program that asks you to enter a CPF number in the format xxx.xxx.xxx-xx and indicate whether it is a valid or invalid number by validating the check digits and formatting characters.

- Exercise 010 - Write a program that asks the user to enter a number up to 99 and prints it out in full on the screen.

- Exercise 011 - Develop a hangman game. The program will take a list of words read from a text file and choose one at random. The player can miss 6 times before being hanged.

      Enter a letter: A
      -> You got it wrong for the 1st time. Try again!

      Type a letter: O
      The word is: _ _ _ _ O

      Type a letter: E
      The word is: _ E _ _ O

      Type a letter: S
      -> You got it wrong for the 2nd time. Try again!

- Exercise 012 - Write a program that reads a phone number, and corrects the number in case it contains only 7 digits, adding the '3' in front. The user can enter the number with or without the dash separator.

      Validates and corrects phone number
      Phone: 461-0133
      Phone has 7 digits. I'll add the digit three in front.
      Fixed phone without formatting: 34610133
      Phone corrected with formatting: 3461-0133

- Exercise 013 - Develop a game in which the user has to guess a word that will be shown with the scrambled letters. The program will take a list of words read from a text file and choose one at random. The player will have six attempts to guess the word. At the end, the word must be shown on the screen, informing if the user won or lost the game.

- Exercise 014 - Leet is a way of writing the Latin alphabet using other symbols instead of letters, such as numbers. The word leet itself admits of many variations, such as l33t or 1337. The use of leet reflects a subculture related to the world of computer and internet games, being widely used to confuse beginners and assert themselves as part of a group. Research the main ways to translate the lyrics. Then, make a program that asks for a text and transforms it to the spelling leet speak.
