### A list of extra exercises for those who are eager to learn. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

The exercises vary in difficulty, some being trivial, others quite challenging.

- Exercise 001 - Write a program that simulates a roll of the dice. Roll the die 100 times and store the results in a vector. Then show how many times each value was achieved. Tip: use a vector of counters(1-6) and a function to generate random numbers, simulating the rolls of the dice
 
- Exercise 002 - ACME Inc., a company of 500 employees, is having disk space problems on its file server. To try to solve this problem, the Network Administrator needs to know the space occupied by the users, and identify the users with the most occupied space. Through a program, downloaded from the Internet, he managed to generate the following file, called "users.txt":

|alexandre | 456123789
:--: | :--:
|anderson | 1245698456
|antonio | 123456456
|carlos | 91257581
|cesar | 987458
|rosemary | 789456125

In this file, the username is 15 characters long. From this file, you must create a program that generates a report, called "report.txt", in the following format:

|ACME Inc. | Usage of disk space by users|||
:--: |:--: | :--: | :--: 
Nr. | Usuário | Used space | % of usage
1 | alexandre | 434,99 MB | 16,85%
2 | anderson | 1187,99 MB | 46,02%
3 | antonio | 117,73 MB | 4,56%
4 | carlos | 87,03 MB | 3,37%
5 | cesar | 0,94 MB | 0,04%
6 | rosemary | 752,88 MB | 29,16%

Total occupied space: 2581.57 MB
Average space occupied: 430.26 MB

The input file must be read only once, and the data stored in memory, if necessary, in order to speed up the execution of the program. The conversion of the space occupied on disk, from bytes to megabytes, must be done through a separate function, which will be called by the main program. The percentage of use must also be calculated through a function, which will be called by the main program.

- Exercise 003 - Write a program that reads an array of 5 integers and displays them.

- Exercise 004 - Write a program that reads an array of 10 real numbers and displays them in reverse order.

- Exercise 005 - Make a Program that reads 4 grades, shows the grades and the average on the screen.

- Exercise 006 - Write a program that reads a 10-character vector, and tells you how many consonants were read. Print the consonants.

- Exercise 007 - Write a program that reads 20 integers and stores them in an array. Store the even numbers in the EVEN vector and the ODD numbers in the odd vector. Print the three vectors.
 
- Exercise 008 - Make a program that asks for the four grades of 10 students, calculate and store the average of each student in a vector, print the number of students with an average greater than or equal to 7.0.

- Exercise 009 - Write a program that reads a vector of 5 integers, displays the sum, multiplication and numbers.
 
- Exercise 010 - The ages and heights of 30 students were recorded. Make a program that determines how many students over 13 are taller than the average height of these students.
 
- Exercise 011 - Make a program that takes the average temperature for each month of the year and stores them in a list. After that, calculate the annual average of temperatures and show all temperatures above the annual average, and in which month they occurred (show the month in full: 1 – January, 2 – February, . . . ).
 
- Exercise 012 - Write a program that reads an indefinite number of values, corresponding to grades, ending the data entry when a value equal to -1 is informed (which should not be stored). After this data entry, do: Show the amount of values that were read; Display all values in the order they were entered, one next to the other; Display all values in reverse order, one below the other; Calculate and display the sum of the values; Calculate and display the average of the values; Calculate and display the amount of values above the calculated average; Calculate and display the number of values below seven; End the program with a message;
 
- Exercise 013 - Use a list to solve the following problem. A company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The seller receives $200 per week plus 9 percent of his gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who had gross sales of $3000 in one week receives $200 plus 9 percent of $3000, for a total of $470. Write a program (using an array of counters) that determines how many salespeople received salaries in the following ranges of values:

|$200  |$299|
:--:|:--:
|$300  |$399|
|$400  |$499|
|$500  |$599|
|$600  |$699|
|$700  |$799|
|$800  |$899|
|$900  |$999|
|$1000 |onwards|

Challenge: Create a formula to get to the list position from salary, without doing lots of nested ifs.
 
- Exercise 014 - Using lists, write a program that asks a person 5 questions about a crime. The questions are: "Did you call the victim?", "Were you at the crime scene?", "Do you live near the victim?", "Did it to the victim?", "Have you ever worked with the victim?". The program must at the end issue a rating on the person's participation in crime. If the person answers positively to 2 questions, they should be classified as "Suspect", between 3 and 4 as "Accomplice" and 5 as "Murderer". Otherwise, he will be classified as "Innocent". 
 
- Exercise 015 - In a long jump competition each athlete is entitled to five jumps. The athlete's result will be determined by the average of the remaining five values. You must make a program that receives the name and the five distances reached by the athlete in his jumps and then informs the name, the jumps and the average of the jumps. The program must be closed when the athlete's name is not informed. The program output should look like the example below:

Athlete: Rodrigo Curvello
 
First Jump: 6.5m
Second Jump: 6.1 m
Third Jump: 6.2 m
Fourth Jump: 5.4 m
Fifth Jump: 5.3 m

Final result:
Athlete: Rodrigo Curvello
Jumps: 6.5 - 6.1 - 6.2 - 5.4 - 5.3
Average jumps: 5.9 m
