### A list of extra exercises for those who are eager to learn. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

The exercises vary in difficulty, some being trivial, others quite challenging.

- Exercise 001 - Write a program that simulates a roll of the dice. Roll the die 100 times and store the results in a vector. Then show how many times each value was achieved. Tip: use a vector of counters(1-6) and a function to generate random numbers, simulating the rolls of the dice
 
- Exercise 002 - ACME Inc., a company of 500 employees, is having disk space problems on its file server. To try to solve this problem, the Network Administrator needs to know the space occupied by the users, and identify the users with the most occupied space. Through a program, downloaded from the Internet, he managed to generate the following file, called "users.txt":

|alexandre | 456123789
:--: | :--:
|anderson | 1245698456
|antonio | 123456456
|carlos | 91257581
|cesar | 987458
|rosemary | 789456125

In this file, the username is 15 characters long. From this file, you must create a program that generates a report, called "report.txt", in the following format:

|ACME Inc. | Usage of disk space by users|||
:--: |:--: | :--: | :--: 
Nr. | Usuário | Used space | % of usage
1 | alexandre | 434,99 MB | 16,85%
2 | anderson | 1187,99 MB | 46,02%
3 | antonio | 117,73 MB | 4,56%
4 | carlos | 87,03 MB | 3,37%
5 | cesar | 0,94 MB | 0,04%
6 | rosemary | 752,88 MB | 29,16%

Total occupied space: 2581.57 MB
Average space occupied: 430.26 MB

The input file must be read only once, and the data stored in memory, if necessary, in order to speed up the execution of the program. The conversion of the space occupied on disk, from bytes to megabytes, must be done through a separate function, which will be called by the main program. The percentage of use must also be calculated through a function, which will be called by the main program.
