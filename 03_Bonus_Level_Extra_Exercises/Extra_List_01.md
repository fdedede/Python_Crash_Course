- Exercise 005 - Make a program that calculates the area of a square, then show double this area to the user. - [Solution](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python_Crash_Course/blob/main/03_Bonus_Level_Extra_Exercises/01_sequential_structure/ex005.py)

- Exercise 006 - Make a program that asks how much you earn per hour and the number of hours worked in the month. Calculate and display your total salary for that month. - [Solution](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python_Crash_Course/blob/main/03_Bonus_Level_Extra_Exercises/01_sequential_structure/ex006.py)

- Exercise 007 - Make a program that asks for 2 integers and a real number. Calculate and show: - [Solution](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python_Crash_Course/blob/main/03_Bonus_Level_Extra_Exercises/01_sequential_structure/ex007.py)

      a) the product of the double of the first and half of the second.

      b) the sum of the triple of the first and the third.

      c) the third cubed. 

- Exercise 008 - Having as input the height (h) of a person, build an algorithm that calculates its ideal weight, using the following formulas: - [Solution](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python_Crash_Course/blob/main/03_Bonus_Level_Extra_Exercises/01_sequential_structure/ex008.py)

      For men: (72.7*h) - 58
      For women: (62.1*h) - 44.7 
                

- Exercise 009 - João, a good man, bought a computer to monitor the daily income of his work. Every time he brings in a weight of fish greater than that established by the state fishing regulations (50 kilos) he must pay a fine of R$4.00 per excess kilo. João needs you to write a program that reads the variable weight (weight of fish) and calculates the excess. Record in the excess variable the amount of kilos beyond the limit and in the fine variable the amount of the fine that João must pay.
Print the program data with the appropriate messages. - [Solution](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python_Crash_Course/blob/main/03_Bonus_Level_Extra_Exercises/01_sequential_structure/ex009.py)

    - For each kg above the established 50kg, a fine of R$4.00 per excess kg;
    - Create a program that reads the amount of fish in kg and says the surplus;
    - Create a variable that receives the extra value;
    - Calculate the amount of the fine. 


- Exercise 010 - Make a program that asks how much you earn per hour and the number of hours worked in the month. Calculate and show the total of your salary in that month, knowing that 11% is deducted for Income Tax, 8% for the INSS and 5% for the union, make a program that gives us: - [Solution](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python_Crash_Course/blob/main/03_Bonus_Level_Extra_Exercises/01_sequential_structure/ex010.py)

      a) gross salary.
      b) how much you paid to the INSS.
      c) how much he paid to the union.
      d) the net salary.
      e) calculate the discounts and the net salary, according to the table below:

      + Gross Salary: R$
      - Income Tax (11%): BRL
      - INSS (8%): BRL
      - Union (5%): BRL
      = Net Salary: R$
      Obs.: Gross Salary - Discounts = Net Salary.


- Exercise 011 - Make a program that asks for the size of a download file (in MB) and the speed of an Internet link (in Mbps), calculate and report the approximate download time of the file using this link (in minutes). - [Solution](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python_Crash_Course/blob/main/03_Bonus_Level_Extra_Exercises/01_sequential_structure/ex011.py)

- Exercise 012 - Make a Program for a paint shop: The program should ask for the size in square meters of the area to be painted. Assume that the paint coverage is 1 liter for every 6 square meters and that the paint is sold in 18 liter cans, that cost R$ 80.00 or in gallons of 3.6 liters, which cost R$ 25.00. Inform the user of the quantities of ink to be purchased and the respective prices in 3 situations: - [Solution](https://github.com/marcoshsq/Python_Crash_Course/blob/main/03_Bonus_Level_Extra_Exercises/01_sequential_structure/ex012.py)

      a) buy only 18 liter cans;
      b) buy only 3.6 liter gallons;
      c) mix cans and gallons, so that paint waste is less.

      Add 10% clearance and always round the values up, ie, consider full cans.
