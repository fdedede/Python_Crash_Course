# Extra Exercise 003: let's Code

'''Let's make a program to verify who is the murderer of a crime.
To find the killer, the police make a short quiz with 5
questions where the answer can only be yes or no:

A. Do they live near the victim?
B. Have they ever worked with the victim?
C. Did they called the victim?
D. Were they at the crime scene? 
E. Did they owe the victim?

Each yes answer gives one point to the suspect. The police consider that
suspects with 5 points are murderers, with 4 to 3 points are accomplices and
2 points are only suspect, needing further investigation. Values
equal to or below 1 are released.'''
