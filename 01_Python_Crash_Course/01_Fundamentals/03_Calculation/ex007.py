# Exercise 007: Average
"""Develop a program that reads a student's grades, calculates and displays their average."""

# First we ask for the grades
score_a = float(input("Enter the student's first grade: "))
score_b = float(input("Enter the student's second grade: "))

# Then we calculate the average
average = (score_a + score_b) / 2

# Finally, we print u.u
print(f"The student average grade was {average}")
