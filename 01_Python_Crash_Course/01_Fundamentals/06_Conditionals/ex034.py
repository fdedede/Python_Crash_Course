wage = float(input('Insert a value: '))
if wage >= 1250 :
    print(f'Your salary is R${wage:.2f} became R${wage * 1.1:.2f}, the value of the increase was R${(wage * 1.1) - wage:.2f}')
else :
    print(f'Your salary is R${wage:.2f} became R${wage * 1.15:.2f}, the value of the increase was R${(wage * 1.15) - wage:.2f}')
