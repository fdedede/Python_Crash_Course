# Exercise 031 - Travel Cost
'''Develop a program that asks the distance of a trip in Km.
Calculate the ticket price, charging R$0.50 per km for travel
of up to 200Km and R$0.45 for longer trips.'''

distance = float(input('What is the distance to be covered: '))
print(f'You will take a trip of {distance:.2f}Km')


# Normal way
if distance <= 200 :
    value_01 = distance * 0.50
    print(f'The ticket price will be R${value_01:.2f}')
else :
    value_02 = distance * 0.45
    print(f'The ticket price will be R${value_02:.2f}')

# or
price = distance * 0.50 if distance <= 200 else distance * 0.45   
print(f'The ticket price will be R${price}')
