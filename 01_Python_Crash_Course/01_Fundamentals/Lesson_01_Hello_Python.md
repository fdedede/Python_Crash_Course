### Before we start you need to have a place to write your code. right?

If you are interested in installing Python on your computer, along with an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (if you don't know what an IDE is, is an acronym  for integrated development environment, think of it like a software that will help you write Python), you must first go to the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it. Now for IDE's, I like to use [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) but you can use [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

But I don't wanna make you install anything, at least for now, so I'll recommend you use [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) which is a web-based interactive computing platform, or if you have a Google account, you can use the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), tha is basically, Google's jupyter notebook, but you can save it on Google Drive. If you need a tutorial to get started with Google Colab use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYoEyIHL6A).
