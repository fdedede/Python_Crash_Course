### Before we start you need to have a place to write your code. right?

If you are interested in installing Python on your computer, along with an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (if you don't know what an IDE is, is an acronym  for integrated development environment, think of it like a software that will help you write Python), you must first go to the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it. Now for IDE's, I like to use [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) but you can use [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

But I don't wanna make you install anything, at least for now, so I'll recommend you use [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) which is a web-based interactive computing platform, or if you have a Google account, you can use the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), tha is basically, Google's jupyter notebook, but you can save it on Google Drive. If you need a tutorial to get started with Google Colab use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYoEyIHL6A).

### The Golden Rule:

Once you have your Jupyter notebook open, you must be wanting to do something right? Why don't you write something. The problem is, computers are dumb, they don't understand what you want them to do unless you "give the orders" in a very specific way. And that's the golden rule of programming, and it's the rule you're going to have the most trouble with. The rule is simple, once you've found a problem that you want/need to solve using code, you need to do two things:
1. Solving the problem in a structured way that the computer can follow, we call it an algorithm. (hardest part);
2. Write your algorithm in a way that the computer understands. That's the syntax. (Not that hard after some practice).

But don't worry, this is the kind of thing that take a while to get it, so don't rush it. But with that said, let's try to write our first program, shall we?

### The Print Function

When you started playing around with Python, one thing you might notice is that you can enter numbers but not text, this is because text has special delimiters, so not to cause confusion in Python, we put this type of data, in quotes, it can be double or single quotes (' ', " "), usually single quotes are used. So when you want to write a text message (and don't worry we'll talk about data types in a moment) you have to use quotes. But not just writing, you want to see what happens right? To see what you are doing in python you need to use a function, in python all commands are functions, we have built-in functions, we have the functions that come with packages and eventually you will learn to create your own. But for now let's use one of the most important built-in function, the print function.
