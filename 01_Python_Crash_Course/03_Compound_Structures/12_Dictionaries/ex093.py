# Exercise 093 - Football Player Registration

'''Create a program that manages the performance of a football player. 
The program will read the player's name and how many matches he played. 
Then you will read the number of goals scored in each match. 
In the end, all this will be stored in a dictionary, 
including the total goals scored during the championship.'''
