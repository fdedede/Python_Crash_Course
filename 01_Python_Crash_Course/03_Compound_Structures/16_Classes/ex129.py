# Exercise 129 - Hidden Door

'''Create a "hidden door" in the virtual pet program's program that displays the 
exact values of the object's attributes. Achieve this by displaying 
the object when a secret option, not listed in the menu, 
is given in the user's choice. Tip: add a special str() method to the Pet class.
