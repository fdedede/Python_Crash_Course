Have a function to print the values of the Point class
Have a function to find the center of a rectangle.
You must create some objects of the Rectangle class.
Each object must have a starting vertex, for example the lower left vertex of the rectangle, which must be an object of class Point.
The function to find the center of the rectangle must return the value for an object of type point that indicates the values of x and y for the center of the object.
The object center value should be shown on the screen
