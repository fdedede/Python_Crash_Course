# Exercise 126 - Investment Account Class

'''Make an Investment Account class that is similar to
 the Bank Account class, with the difference that an interestrate attribute is added. 
 Provide a builder that configures both the starting balance and the interest rate. 
 Provide an addInterest method (with no explicit parameter) that adds interest to 
 the account. Write a program that builds a savings account with an opening 
 balance of $1000.00 and an interest rate of 10%. Then apply the addInterest() 
 method five times and print the resulting balance.
