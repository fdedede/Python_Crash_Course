# Exercise 125 - Car class

'''Implement a class called Car with the following properties:

- A vehicle has a certain fuel consumption (measured in km/liter) and a certain amount of fuel in the tank.
- Consumption is specified in the builder and the initial fuel level is 0.
- Provide a walk( ) method that simulates driving the vehicle a certain distance, reducing the fuel level in the gas tank.
- Provide a getGasoline() method, which returns the current fuel level.
- Provide an addGasoline() method to fill the tank. Example of use:

myVehicle = Car(15); # 15 kilometers per liter of fuel.
myVehicle.addGasoline(20); # refills with 20 liters of fuel.
myVehicle.floor(100); # walk 100 kilometers.
myVehicle.getGasoline() # Print the fuel remaining in the tank.
