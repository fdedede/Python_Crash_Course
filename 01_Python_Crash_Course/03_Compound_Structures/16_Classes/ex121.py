# Exercise 121 - Virtual Pet Class

'''Create a class that models a Tamagushi (Electronic Pet): 

Attributes: Name, Hunger, Health and Age b. 
Methods: Change Name, Hunger, Health and Age; Return Name, Hunger, Health and Age 
Note: There is one more piece of information that we must take into account, 
the Mood of our tamagushi, this mood is a combination of the Hunger and Health 
attributes, that is, a calculated field, so we should not create a attribute 
to store this information because it can be calculated at any time.
