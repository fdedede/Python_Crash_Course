# Exercise 130 - Pet Farm

'''Create a Pet Farm by instantiating multiple pet objects and keeping track of 
them through a list. Imitate how the basic program works, but instead of 
requiring the user to take care of a single pet, require him to take care of 
the entire farm. Each menu option should allow the user to perform an action 
for all pets (feed all pets, play with all pets, or listen to all pets). 
To make the show more interesting, 
give each pet a random initial level of hunger and boredom.
